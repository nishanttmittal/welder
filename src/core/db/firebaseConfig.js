 * It is also the biggest LOAD-TIME factor (measured 2026-08-04): from github.io the
 * hidden /__/auth/iframe is cross-origin and cost 1,220 ms on a cold open; the
 * identical fetch same-origin took 37 ms.

/**
 * EXACT hosts whose own /__/auth/handler is registered with the Google OAuth client.
 * Matching is exact — NOT by suffix.
 *
 * ⚠️ Why not `*.web.app` / `*.firebaseapp.com`: a suffix test trusts ANY Firebase
 * site, including ones whose redirect URI was never registered. `unico-plating.web.app`
 * and `unico-welder.web.app` both exist and both FAIL Google sign-in with
 * redirect_uri_mismatch (July 2026). Trusting them by suffix would hand the auth
 * handler to a domain that cannot complete a login. Only `firebaseapp.com` — the
 * project default — is pre-registered; `.web.app` and custom domains are not.
 *
 * ⚠️ A host belongs here ONLY after BOTH registrations are done:
 *   1. Firebase console → Auth → Settings → Authorized domains → add it, AND
 *   2. Google Cloud console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 client
 *      "Web client (auto created by Google Service)" → add redirect URI
 *      https://<host>/__/auth/handler  + JS origin  https://<host>
 * The host must also actually SERVE Firebase Hosting's reserved /__/auth/* paths
 * (a Hosting custom domain — not a proxy/CDN in front of one). Verify with a REAL
 * sign-in before adding: reaching Google's account chooser = registered;
 * accounts.google.com/.../oauth/error?...redirect_uri_mismatch = not.
